## 🔀 Total Harmonic Distortion — Unity Translation

In traditional electrical engineering, Total Harmonic Distortion (THD) is calculated per phase, based on the sum of non-fundamental frequency components divided by the fundamental:

```
THD_A = √(V₂² + V₃² + ...) / V₁
```

This results in a percentage value for each phase (A, B, and C), and by standard IEEE practice, these percentages are not directly additive because they are non-linear and phase-relative.

However, at Unity, we take a **field-level view of harmonic behavior** — aligning with Maxwell's electromagnetic theory rather than purely scalar wave math.

We define:

```
THD_Field_Composite = THD_A + THD_B + THD_C
```

This is not a textbook THD, but a **Unity Composite Index** — a metric designed to:
• Reflect total harmonic stress on the energy field,
• Enable fast field diagnostics,
• Map distortion across the 3-phase envelope as a combined entity.

Think of it as a **harmonic heat index**, not a scalar voltage quantity.

| Metric | Value | Notes |
| ------ | ----- | ----- |
| THD Phase A (%) | 7.8% | IEEE standard per-phase calculation |
| THD Phase B (%) | 7.6% | IEEE standard per-phase calculation |
| THD Phase C (%) | 7.4% | IEEE standard per-phase calculation |
| Unity THD Composite (%) | 22.9% | Field-level stress indicator |
| Max Phase THD | 7.8% | Highest THD among all three phases |
| Min Phase THD | 7.4% | Lowest THD among all three phases |

### Engineering Commentary

This composite score is useful when assessing transformer health, load imbalance, or predicting heating and harmonic clustering (G1–G8 groups). It's used in our eBehavior overlays and directly informs Unity's Voltage Health Index (VHI).

If IEEE compliance is required, individual THD values remain visible and can be cross-checked per phase.

⚠️ **Note on THD Composite**: Unity's THD Composite is not a scalar addition per IEEE. It is a field-behavior indicator that helps us track total harmonic impact across all three phases — a core component of transformer-level heat modeling.

## Capacity Utilization

- **Maximum UtilityDemand:** 1,656.31 kW
  - **Maximum Load:** 1,851.57 kVA
  - **Percentage of Capacity (MAX):** 74.1%
- **Average Load:** 1,026.21 kVA
  - **Percentage of Capacity (Avg):** 41.0%

## kVA and Power Factor Analysis (Measured vs Calculated)

### Measured Values (PRIMARY - Used for All Analysis)

- **Average kVA (Ssum_kVA):** 1,026.21 kVA
- **Average Power Factor (PF):** 0.851

**Source:** Direct meter measurements (instantaneous values averaged over time)

### Calculated Values (VERIFICATION ONLY)

- **Calculated kVA (V×I×√3/1000):** 1,033.18 kVA

**Calculation Inputs:**
- Average Voltage (VIavg_V): 479.72 V
- Average Current (Iavg_A): 1243.44 A
- Average kW (Psum_kW): 880.61 kW

### Differences (Measured vs Calculated)
- **kVA Difference:** 6.97 kVA (0.7%)
- **Calculated PF (kW/kVA from averages):** 0.852
- **Power Factor Difference:** 0.002 (0.2%)

### Why Measured Values Are More Accurate

When voltage and current vary over time (which they always do in real systems):
- **Average(V × I) ≠ Average(V) × Average(I)** due to the non-linear multiplication
- **Time-weighted PF ≠ kW/kVA from averages** due to load variation effects

The meter's instantaneous measurements capture these variations correctly, while
calculations from averaged values systematically underestimate reactive effects.

**Analysis Method:** All heat calculations, thermal burden, and cost analysis use
the measured kVA (1026.21) and measured PF (0.851) values.
Calculated values are shown above for verification and engineering transparency.
